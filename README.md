### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Oskar Sommer

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into applied AI and data science after completing the full-time **Data Science & AI Bootcamp at Le Wagon Berlin (Janâ€“Mar 2025)**.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m especially interested in how AI can be used to **solve real-world problems** and improve **human-centered applications** â€“ from health tech to business process optimization.

### ðŸš€ Projects

**Leuk-Detect**  
Team project (4 members) built at Le Wagon:  
â†’ Developed an AI model to predict blood cancer from microscope images using **Vision Transformers**  
â†’ Reached **96% accuracy**, outperforming traditional models  
â†’ Built a complete prediction pipeline: image upload â†’ API processing â†’ result return  
â†’ Handled data preprocessing and model architecture testing (18,000+ images across 15 classes)

Currently learning more about:
- Foundation models and their application in non-NLP domains  
- Data-centric AI & model interpretability  
- Full-stack deployment of AI systems

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Smart, purpose-driven AI projects  
- Early-stage prototypes with real-world application potential  
- Anything that combines **machine learning** + **impact**
